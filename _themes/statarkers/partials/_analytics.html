Enter your Google analytics code here, you can just enter your account id here UA-XXXXX-X.
The analytics is wrapped in a conditional which will stop google tracker your site when
on a development server. You will need to uncomment the enable_analytics variables in the 
dev and live yaml files. These are located in the environments folder which is located in the _config folder.

Once this is in place you can set up your eviroments in the settings.yaml file located in the _config folder.
