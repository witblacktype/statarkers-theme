Born from the idea of a blank canvas for starting your Statamic sites, this theme is loosely based on the popular [Starkers](http://viewportindustries.com/products/starkers/) theme for Wordpress. The idea being that you load this theme into your Statamic themes folder, add the dummy content, get designing and building your Statamic sites in even less time than you were already.

You can use Statarkers in any way you wish, please feel free to fork it on github. As the theme is offered for free, it's also offered with limited support. If you find a bug, please let me know and I'll fix it as soon as possible. Any improvements and feature requests can be asked through github.

Happy Statamic Themeing!
